## üéØ Current Focus

The basic particle system is working! You can:

1. **Interact with particles**: Click to spawn, move mouse to push
2. **Adjust settings**: Use the control panel to tweak all parameters
3. **Switch themes**: Dark/light mode toggle
4. **Export/Import**: Save your configurations as JSON files

The system supports hundreds to thousands of particles with smooth performance, depending on your hardware.

## üêõ Known Issues

- Mobile touch interactions need refinement
- Performance could be better on older devices

## üöÄ Ready for Development

The foundation is solid and ready for iterative development. All components are modular and can be extended easily. The configuration system makes it easy to experiment with different effects and behaviors.

**Start the dev server**: `npm run dev`
**Build for production**: `npm run build`
**Preview production build**: `npm run preview`

## üöÄ Deployment

The project is set up for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions:

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers a build and deployment
2. **Manual Deployment**: You can also trigger deployment manually from the GitHub Actions tab
3. **Live Site**: Once deployed, the site will be available at `https://cameronfoxly.github.io/spark-particles/`

### Setting Up GitHub Pages (One-time setup)

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. The workflow will handle the rest automatically

### Local Testing
- Run `npm run build` to test the production build locally
- Run `npm run preview` to preview the built application
